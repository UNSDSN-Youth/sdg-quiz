GohGoh is a wonderful humpback whale swimming in the ocean. 

GohGoh and his friends turn the body upside down when they see the scuba diver. 

To inform the diver that it is dangerous to go further down below! 

Once the diver met a large shark, a humpback whale friend followed him down and saved the diver. 

Because of this, GohGoh and his friends are nicknamed the pacifists of the sea. 

Let's also think about what we can do for peace in everyday life like GohGoh.

GohGoh is a wonderful humpback whale swimming in the ocean. 

GohGoh and his friends turn their body upside down when they see the scuba diver. 

This is to inform the diver that it is dangerous to go further down below! 

One time, a diver met a large shark. Our humpback whale friend followed him down and saved the diver. 

Because of this, GohGoh and his friends are nicknamed the protectors of the sea. 

Let's also think about what we can do for peace in everyday life, just like our GohGoh.

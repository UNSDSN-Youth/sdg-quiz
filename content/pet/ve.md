You just got a pet!

Ve is a diligent worker bee. It is said that we are able to see colorful flowers thanks to Ve who has worked so hard. 

However, the friends of this important Ve are threatened with extinction because of environmental pollution.

So you have to work with Ve to solve the environmental problems around the world, from the murderous heat waves of the continent of Europe, the plastic trash islands of the Pacific to Asia's air pollution.

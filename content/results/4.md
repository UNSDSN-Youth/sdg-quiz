You are Goal 4!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Stay informed.** 

Follow your local news and stay in touch with the Global Goals online or on social media at @GlobalGoalsUN. 

**2. Donate what you donâ€™t use.** 

Local charities will give your gently used clothes, books and furniture a new life. 

**3. Eat less meat, poultry, and fish.** 

More resources are used to provide meat than plants.

You are Goal 10!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Knowing my rights**

Knowing that every person has right to be protected just as I do.

**2. Accept differences**

Try not to consider being 'different’ as being 'wrong’

**3. Think about your own morals.**

Note that social conventions are not always the most morally accepting.

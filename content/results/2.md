You are Goal 2!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. If you have a fruit or snack that you don’t want, don’t throw it out.** 

Give it away to someone who needs and is asking for help.

**2. Buy the funny fruit**

Many fruits and vegetables are thrown out because their size, shape, or color are not “right”. 

Buying these perfectly good funny fruit, at the farmer’s market or elsewhere, utilizes food that might otherwise go to waste. 

**3. Shop Smart**

Plan meals, use shopping lists and avoid impulse buys. Don’t succumb to marketing tricks that lead you to buy more food than you need, particularly for perishable items. Though these may be less expensive per ounce, they can be more expensive overall if much of that food is discarded.

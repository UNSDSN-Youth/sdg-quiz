You are Goal 13!

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Activism**

Join campaigns that speak against actions that cause climate change

**2. Travel smart**

Use public transport!

**3. Use energy wisely**

Monitor your energy usage. For example, reducing the time you use air conditioners and heating indoors. Adjust your thermostat, lower in winter, higher in summer.

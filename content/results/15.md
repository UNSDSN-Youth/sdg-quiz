You are Goal 15!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Be wary of the entire ecosystem**

Respect that the ecosystem spans beyond water and try not to break it.

**2. The world does not revolve around humans**

Be wary of the fact that we are not the only ones who inhabit the planet. We must care for Earth for the rest of our environment too.

**3. Reduce your personal wastage**

Make an effort to reduce the amount of trash you produce. This may mean buying products with recyclable packaging, not using disposable items, etc.

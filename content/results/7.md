You are Goal 7!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Watch your usage**

Save electricity by plugging appliances into a power strip, and turning them off completely when not in use, including your computer.

**2. Turn off the lights.** 

Your TV or computer screen provides a cosy glow, so turn off other lights if you donâ€™t need them.

**3. Air dry.** 

Let your hair and clothes dry naturally instead of running a machine. If you do wash your clothes, make sure the load is full.

**4. Check for openings**

Plug air leaks in windows and doors to increase energy efficiency.

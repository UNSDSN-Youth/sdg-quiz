You are Goal 9!

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Shop local.** 

Supporting neighbourhood businesses keep people employed, and helps prevent trucks from driving far distances.

**2. Take public transport.** 

Save the car trips for when youâ€™ve got a big group.

**3. Shop smart**

Please use companies that contribute to sustainable development, and are environment-friendly.

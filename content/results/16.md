You are Goal 16!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Think about your own morals.**

Note that social conventions are not always the most morally accepting.

**2. Pay attention to your surroundings**

Paying attention to the movement of the institutions making actions for the world, and get involved.

**3. And act.**

Do not just watch. Act in these movements of institutions who value peace and justice. Physically and mentally.

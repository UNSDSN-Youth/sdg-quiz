You are Goal 3!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Vaccinate yourself and your kids.** 

Protecting your family from disease also aids public health.

**2. Explore your healthcare rights**

Does everyone at work have access to healthcare? Find out what your rights are to work. Fight against inequality.

**3. Stay fit**

Try to exercise, even light exercise like taking a walk a day is a start. Start proper eating habits. A severe diet is not good for your health.

You are Goal 17!

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. The world does not revolve around humans**

Be wary of the fact that we are not the only ones who inhabit the planet. We must work together to care for Earth.

**2. Keep updated on world news**

Pay attention to situations of people also in other countries.

**3. Take ownership**

Considering the challenges in some parts of the world also as challenges of me. Just because something is happening far away, does not mean that it doesn't effect me.

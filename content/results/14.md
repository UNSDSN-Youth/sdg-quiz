You are Goal 14!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Be wary of the entire ecosystem**

Respect that the ecosystem spans beyond water and try not to break it.

**2. Reuse water**

You can also save water, through reuse. Think rain water storage!

**3. Short showers**

Shortening the time of showering. A standard shower wases 2.5 gallons of water per minute!

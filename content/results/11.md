You are Goal 11!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Follow the lead**

Pay attention to what other cities (especially those who are well known for their sustainability and good urban planning), and learn from the success stories.

**2. Think of your own ideas**

Contact your local government or council to submit your own ideas about how they can be more sustainable.

**3. Forward thinking**

Think about your environment not only as the place you live, but also the place the next generations will live at too.

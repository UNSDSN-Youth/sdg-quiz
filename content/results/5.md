You are Goal 5!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Look out!**

Reassess whether you are making sexist remarks in spite of yourself. You can start to change yourself.

**2. Speak out**

Speak up! If you feel that there is gender discrimination, do not take it. 

**3. Do not stay put**

Women earn 10 to 30 per cent less than men for the same work. Pay inequality persists everywhere. Voice your support for equal pay for equal work.

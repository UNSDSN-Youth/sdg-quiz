You are Goal 8!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Shop Smart**

Plan meals, use shopping lists and avoid impulse buys.

**2. Research**

Do a bit of online research and buy only from companies that you know have sustainable practices and don’t harm the environment. Express postage can be extremely bad for our environment, as it prioritises quickness over efficient delivery.

**3. Shop vintage.** 

Brand new isn’t necessarily best. See what you can repurpose from second-hand shops.

You are Goal 12!
---

How can I achieve my goal?

**1. Think before I buy**

Do not just buy for the sake of buying, think about whether you really need the product or not.

**2. Buy selectively**

Try to purchase eco-friendly, or fair trade products.

**3. Think about the entire process**

Remember there is an entire production lifecycle that has come in before reaching your hands. Be wary of the ethics and waste made in creating the products that you buy.
